Product Page

HTML, Bulma(CSS), JavaScript

This small project was a way for me to learn and develop my skills with Bulma (https://bulma.io/), a CSS framework. The product page is responsive and adjust depending on screen size used. Through this project I learnt to implement a number of different elements with Bulma, such as modals, forms, cards, burger nav, and breadscrumbs.
